# Software Project Management Course Design
Based on human posture, we can develop various applications, such as fitness or yoga trackers. As an example, we showcase an AI Squat Counter, which can automatically track user data or verify the quality of the performed exercise. Such use cases can be achieved by using additional classifier networks or simple pairwise distance lookup algorithms that match the closest pose in a normalized pose space. This project uses the MediaPipe toolkit, where MediaPipe Pose is an ML solution for high-fidelity body pose tracking, leveraging our BlazePose research to infer 33 3D landmarks and background segmentation masks for the entire body from RGB video frames. One of the applications that BlazePose can achieve is fitness, specifically posture classification and repetition counting. Push-ups and squats, as the most common exercises, will be used for demonstration.
